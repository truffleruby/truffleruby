# ENV is a core library object rather than part of the C API, but its contract
# with native extensions is: the process environment is shared, so a variable
# that an extension sets with setenv() must be visible to ENV, and one that ENV
# sets must be visible to getenv(). Testing that requires calling the C library
# directly, so the spec lives with the other specs that need a native
# extension, and runs on any implementation to check the two agree.
